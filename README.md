# SRK-Codebase

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is a public collection of projects, tools, numerical experiments, and learning explorations created by **Sarath Radhakrishnan**, spanning:

- Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- Machine Learning & Model Conversion
- Scientific Computing
- Numerical Methods
- Fun coding
- General programming utilities

This repo is meant to:
- serve as a consolidated reference of my research & development work
- help other developers understand & reuse code
- track my evolution as a problem solver
