# FUN – Coding for Enjoyment & Learning

This section contains playful or exploratory coding projects done out of curiosity and enjoyment rather than research or formal development.

Currently included:

- **ProjectEuler/** — Numerical and algorithmic Python challenges
                  This area of the repo highlights experimentation, problem-solving, and computational thinking outside academic or engineering constraints.
- FourierVisuals/ - General math/python challenge
                    This area of the repo is a fun project to challenge myself
